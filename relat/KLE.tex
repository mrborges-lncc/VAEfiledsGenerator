The eigenvalues associated with the eigenfunctions provide
a measure of the energy contained in the respective mode.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To quantify the energy involved in a truncated \kl\ expansion (with $\m$ modes) we define the total relative energy as
\begin{equation}
 \Enn{\m} = \dfrac{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{\m}\avaj}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\avai},
\end{equation}

\noindent in which the denominator will be approximated using $30,000$ eigenvalues ($\sum_{i=1}^{30,000}\avai$).


The \fig{eigenvalues} shows the behavior of the eigenvalues, the energy contained, and the average error as a function of the number of modes ($\m$) for the three covariance functions considered in this study.
The decay of the eigenvalues of the square exponential case is much faster than the exponential case. The latter requires a more significant number of modes to capture the same energy when compared to the first one.
